Many things have happened recently. The first is the computer self-study stage. I have learned the part of mybatis, but there is still a long way to go. There are too many things to learn. In the future, we have to integrate all the learned knowledge. I really don't know how programmers should work in the future. The second thing is the most important thing for me to study abroad. Although there are two more offers, they are not painful and itchy. The offer I really want hasn't come yet. I don't say much about the rest. Now although I'm sitting in the library studying, my heart is very anxious and flustered. It's really hard to feel. PTE learning is really boring and boring. I don't know what to say. I'll go to dinner first and write an argument letter later. That stupid intermediary doesn't even include an argument letter. I have to write it myself. If the offer hadn't come yet, I would definitely scold them. I'm very tired. My heart is really tired. It's like being hung. It's very uncomfortable. God, help me.
